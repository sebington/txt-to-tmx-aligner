To use this tool, you need to put it in a folder, together with two .txt files containing text, one being the translation of the other.

This tool can be run using [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/): `uv run txt_tmx_aligner.py`

1. Specify your source and target languages (e.g. 'en' and 'fr')
2. Specify your file names (e.g. source-en.txt and target-fr.txt)
3. Give the translation memory a name or just press Enter to use the default
4. You should obtain a valid TMX file, that you can import in your CAT tool
